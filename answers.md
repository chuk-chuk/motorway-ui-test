- To display the responsive UI of images I used Chrome browser.
- Used the support of webp image formats and presented the form to collect user data. The form isn't completed, however gives an idea how custom hooks can be used to target client validation and manipulate the state of the input.
- I added a simple unit tests to demonstrate the knowledge of react testing lib (other tests are skipped due to limited time).
- Slow API can be speed up by not blocking the image load and the use of some sort of caching mechanism to prevent render blocking, and instead serve the result stored in the variable instead.
- A performance API can be used to measure the application speed and load time of the data as well as lighthouse tool.
  Taking the recordings of the page gives sufficient insights on its performance.
